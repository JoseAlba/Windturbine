            <h2>Notes Continued</h2>
            <p>The INSTANT program, written in C++, calculates the mean flow and turbulence velocities at a given location and displays them on the screen. Therefore, the probe orientation can be adjusted accordingly. The details of the INSTANT program can be found in Appendix D.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                Typically, the velocity measurement at a given location consists of two steps: probe
                positioning and data acquisition which were automatically implemented in this study. These two
                steps need to be properly coordinated so that the probe will not traverse while data acquisition is
                in process. This task was undertaken by the C++ program, BRAIN which monitors the status of
                both the motion and data acquisition processes and sends out commands to start a proper action
                at a given time.

            <p>The SmartMotor®motion can be programmed with a high level motor language which has
                keywords for acceleration (A), velocity (V), and distance (D) for position move. Each
                SmarMotor® has two digital I/O ports designated in the motor language as port A and port B.
            </p>

                The SmartMotor®motion can be programmed with a high level motor language which has
                keywords for acceleration (A), velocity (V), and distance (D) for position move. Each
                SmarMotor® has two digital I/O ports designated in the motor language as port A and port B.

                Each of these two ports can be set as either digital input (UXI, where X may be A or B) or digital
                output (UXO). The states of port A and B can be programmatically set to high (UX = 1) or low
                (UX = 0). This digital I/O feature is extremely useful in programming the communication
                between the two motors and the data collection and coordination program BRAIN.exe. Besides
                these features, the motor language has basic looping functions such as WHILE-LOOP which has
                been utilized in the following code to repetitively testing the digital I/O states of the motors.
